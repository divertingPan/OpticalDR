*Once the patent examination phase is complete, we will release our code.*

Kindly note that due to authorization constraints, we are unable to share the AVEC datasets here. Therefore, it is necessary for you to independently extract, crop, and align the facial data. **We have NO authorization to share any raw AVEC dataset. The issue of asking for sharing datasets will be closed.**
